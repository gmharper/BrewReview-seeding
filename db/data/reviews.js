Yes it was strong, but it had a very distinct taste. Occasionally at home I could have one or two too many!...who doesn't? Then Carlsberg decided to lower and lower the alcohol...also went the taste...also went my decision to buy this naff beer anymore.",

They’re actually saving money by doing this as they pay less tax to the government. But do we the customer get any benefit from that? Of course not -the price is just the same, higher in fact. Just that now it has lost body and tastes like a cheap and weak lager. I will certainly never buy this product again and is it is a complete waste of money at the price they are asking.",

It has a well formed head, a mix of different size bubbles make up the foam and these take their time to settle, it’s a really good looking beer.",

Has a punchy tropical nose full of pineapple while also having that classic citrus grapefruit mixed in as well. It’s got a great hop to the body while still being crisp and fresh to drink. A nice bite to the finish helps round it off.",
